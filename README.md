# Learning-from-web-data
Leveraging the abundant number of web data is a promising strategy in addressing the problem of data lacking when training convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, web images often contain incorrect tags, which may compromise the learned CNN model. On the other hand, different data distribution between web and well-labled dataset (called dataset bias or build-in gap) also influence the effectiveness of using web data. To address these problems, we propose two methods that focus on cleaning noisy web data and reducing dataset bias, respectively. Meanwhile, we collect 0.5 million web images covering all categories of four public image classification datasets (SD-198, Stanford Dogs, Food-101 and MIT Indoor67) to support the related research.
